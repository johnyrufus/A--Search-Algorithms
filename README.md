# Problem 1 Author: Xing Liu
# Comments: Folder 'geopy' inside problem 1 is the library for calculating great-circle distance, I found that the department linux server does not have this library installed so I included it. Thanks Chris and Johny for providing a rough code structure, although I decided to start everything from scratch later on but I would like to mention their efforts on problem 1.
